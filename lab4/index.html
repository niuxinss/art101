				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge was to think through different steps of an everyday task, and then a simple computer game. Then, we needed to turn these steps into pseudocode, formatting them as javascript, and creating an html file.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We struggled a little bit with converting the steps into javascript comments, we weren't sure if it had to be more formal and written like how it would be programmed. We decided it would be okay to implement a little bit of technical language to aid in implementation later on.</p>
