			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with ensuring all of our files were correctly formatted & accessible from the homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't any problems, and I feel that is because we are following a template that should resolve the issues of file structures... </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It is going well! I am following the directions, and I am adding a little bit of extra work by ensuring that all links have some sort of way back to the homepage, or to the sheet associated with that lab (see lab 2). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the page as a result of editing the existing HTML file. Here is an image of the code:</p>
